For Homework 4, I used Arrays and Polymorphism to declare strings to print the number of rows and columns. I declared an array of 10 strings to print first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth which showed in the output as the 10 rows and 20 columns of 0.

For Homework 5, I used methods to calculate distance traveled and loops to help display the the distance a vehicle has traveled each hour. I also had to create a filename vehicle.txt to put the vehicle, speed, and time for the code to display out the report for teach type of vehicle. 

# HW6
For Homework 6, for the Month.java file, I used argument constructor to accept number of month as an argument and also used strings argumnent instructor. I also used booleans to return true or false. For the MonthDays.java file, I used integers to declare the month and years. I also used methods to identify leap years to see if would be divisible. Lastly for the MonthYearTester.java file I used integers to declare the number of days in a specific month. The output displayed the number of day in August which is 31 days.


# HW7
For Homework 7, I created instances for each class and declared vaiables so that it can print the mileages of the car until the car runs out of fuel, which is why the current last speed is 0. I also ran a loop with increments of 5 for it to indrease and decrease to 0, for the odometer. I made the year of the model 2003, the make "carmaruti", and the current speed 0.

# HW8 
For Homework 8, for Program 1, I initialized counters and used delimeters to print a word count, and to show the number of sentences, characters, paragraphs, and whitespaces for the number of words each file contains. For Program 2 it evaluates simple expressions such as 5 + 5 and 202  * 105, consisting of a number, an operator, and another number.  The operators +,-, *, / are allowed. The program will read and evaluate expressions until the user inputs a line that starts with the number 0. In the output I calculated the expressions with the different opeartors and it prints the answer to each expression.
